# Honey Shop Website

A static website for a honey shop built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Header and Footer
The header and footer are stored in `components/` and dynamically loaded onto each page via `load-components.js`. This prevents duplication and maintains consistent navigation. \
May be subject to change later

## Usage
- Open `index.html` or any page to view.

## Other notes
- one html, css and js file for each site
- global styles in main.css
- global functions in main.js
- index.html = homepage
- put all the page content within the .main-content div
